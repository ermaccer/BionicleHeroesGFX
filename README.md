### Widescreen "Fix"
This plugin allows you to change the hardcoded value for widescreen (which is forced to 16/9 no matter what),
you might need to enter settings and leave them without saving to see the changes.

You can configure these features in the .ini file.

# Installation
Download binary file from [Releases](https://github.com/ermaccer/BionicleHeroesGFX/releases) page then extract it to main game folder.

This plugin is pattern based so most executables should work, was tested with NOCD .exe and `_2k.exe`.


# Building
Built using Visual Studio 2017.
